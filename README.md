# Telecom_Churn_Analysis
All industries suffer from voluntary churn -- the loss of customers to some other company. The survival of any business is based on its ability to retain customers. This is particularly true for Telecom companies. 
Telecom companies today measure voluntary churn by a monthly figure, such as 1.9 percent or 2.1 percent. This is the average number of customers who quit their service per month. Annual churn rates for telecommunications companies average between 10 percent and 67 percent.

Our Exploratoray Analysis can help understand what could be the reason for the churning of such customers by feature selection and data analysis.
